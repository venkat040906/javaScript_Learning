//Memory creation Phase:
// line 1: x variable is allocated memory and stores 'undfined'
// line 2: y variable is allocated memory and stores 'undfined'
// line 4: getSum() function is allocated memory and stores all the Code
// line 8: sum1 variable is allocated memory and stores 'undfined'
// line 9: sum2 variable is allocated memory and stores 'undfined'

// execution phase:

// line 1: Place the value of 100 into the x variable
// line 1: Place the value of 50 into the y variable
// line 3: skips the function because there is nothing to execute
// line 8: invokes the getSum() function and creates a new function execution context

// Function EC creation phase
// Line 3: n1 & n2 variables are allocated memory and stores 'undefined'
// line 4: sum variable is allocated memory and stores 'undefined'

// function EC execution phase
// line 3: n1 & n2 are assinged 100 and 50
// line 4: calculation is done and 150 is put into the sum varibale
// line 5: return tells the function EC to return to the global ec with value of sum 150
// line 7: returned sum value is put into the sum1 variable
// line 8: open another function execution context and do the same thing with different parameter
